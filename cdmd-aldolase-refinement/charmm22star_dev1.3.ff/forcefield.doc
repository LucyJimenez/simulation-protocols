Parameters derived from c32b1 version of CHARMM
NOTE: Atom-based charge groups

dev 0.1

- ATP/ADP topology and parameters
  (see stream/toppar_all27_na_nad_ppi.str)

- GTP/GDP topology and parameters
 (combined ATP/APD from stream/toppar_all27_na_nad_ppi.str
 and guanosine from top_all27_na.rtf)

dev 1.1

- Topologies for ATP/ADP and GTP/GDP were moved into rna.rtp
  because these are in fact nucleotides

- Hydrogen database (rna.hdb) was extended for ATP/ADP and
  GTP/GDP by analogy with RA and RG

- Vsite database (aminoacids.vsd) was extended to include a
  [NH2] entry for NN1

dev 1.2

- Atom naming in ATP/ADP and GTP/GDP was changed to a more
  convenient one

- Bonded parameters for NA (ffnabonded.itp) were extended
  to include vsite constraints for OH groups of ribose in
  ATP/ADP and GTP/GDP

- Usage of vsites is finally possible

dev 1.2.1 (GROMACS 2018)

- Same version as dev 1.2 but adapted to be used with GROMACS
  2018 upwards

- Changes concerns ONLY ffnabonded.itp, where cn8, cn9 were
  corrected to CN8, CN9

dev 1.3

- Hydrogen database (aminoacids.hdb) was extended for HEME
  as described here
  (https://figshare.com/articles/Cytochrome_CHARMM_heme_parameter_file/1254117/12).
  See also the instructions in HEME_HDB/

- Vsite database (aminoacids.vsd) was NOT touched
